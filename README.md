## Community Structure

This repository is organized into several key sections:

- [members-1.md](members-1.md) - Main index and first 100 members
- [discussion-proposals.md](discussion-proposals.md) - Proposed discussion topics
- [discussions.md](discussions.md) - Archive of completed discussions and resources

## Member Management

Our member list is organized into separate files to maintain performance and readability:

- The first file (`members-1.md`) serves as both an index and contains the first 100 members
- Additional files (`members-2.md`, `members-3.md`, etc.) contain subsequent members
- Each file includes a status indicator (EMPTY/FULL) and current member count
- When a file reaches 100 members, a new file is created using the [members-template.md](members-template.md)

The community is organized into three sections:

1. Core Team - Founding members and key contributors
2. Admins - Community administrators and moderators
3. Members - Regular community members
